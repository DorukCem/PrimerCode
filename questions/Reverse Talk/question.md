# Reverse Talk


Ed and Eddy have come up with a way to talk without their mom understanding them:
they simply reverse each word they say.

## Input
Your function takes a single input 
- `sentence`: a string containing words written in reverse separated by single spaces.

## Output
To decode what they’re saying, reverse each word individually and return the resulting sentence.

## Example
```py
assert(decipher_reverse("steL piks loohcs worromot") == "Lets skip school tomorrow")
```
is correct because each word has been reversed individually.
