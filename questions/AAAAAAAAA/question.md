# AAAAAAAAA

## Story
As you explore the untouched parts of the Amazon forest with your group of fellow adventurers, you start to feel like you're being watched.
One by one, your friends get pulled into the forest.
It seems that the people being dragged away are trying to say something... but they always disappear before they can finish.

For example:

* Explorer 1: `"AaAA-"`
* Explorer 2: `"Arghh-"`

You’re curious to learn what these explorers might have been trying to say in their final moments.

## Task
Return a string described by the procedure below

## Input
Your function takes two inputs:
* `sound`: a string
* `n`: an integer

## Output
Return a string consisting of the `sound` repeated `n` times.

## Example

```python
assert repeat("nooo", 3) == "nooonooonooo"
```
