# Polite sentences


Sentences are polite if they have the word please in them.

## Input
Your function takes a single input 
- `sentence`: a string.

Return True if the `sentence` contains the word `"please"`, regardless of casing. Otherwise, return False.

## Example
```py
assert(is_polite("Please help me") == True)
```
is correct because it has the word "please" in it
