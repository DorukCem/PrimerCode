# Polite sentences
Sentences are polite if they have the word please in them.

Your function takes a single input sentence, which is a string.
Return True if the sentence contains the word "please", regardless of casing. Otherwise, return False.

For example
```py
assert(is_polite("Please help me") == True)
```
is correct because it has the word "please" in it
