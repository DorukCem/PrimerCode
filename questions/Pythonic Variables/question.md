# Pythonic Variables


Peace is almost upon us. The Camel Kingdom has drafted a treaty to end the war.
But the Snake Kingdom refuses to read the filthy document — it's written in camelCase!
Luckily, you've studied both dialects. 
Perhaps you can translate the treaty into snake_case before war breaks out.

## Input
Your function takes a single input 
- `word`: a string written in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).

## Output
You should return the equivalent word in snake_case.

## Example
```py
assert(to_snake("someWord") == "some_word")
```
