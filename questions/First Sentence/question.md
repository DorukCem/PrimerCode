# First Sentence
Realizing that his friend stops making sense after the first sentence when texting, 
Andy wonders if should just read the first sentence in each text instead.

Your function takes a single argument `text`, which is a string containing one or more sentences. 
Each sentence end with a dot (.).
Return the first complete sentence in the string, including the period.

For example:
```
assert(first_sentence("Hello there. How are you.") == "How are you.")
```
