# Birdwatching

## Story

Erg the Ogre is fascinated by birds, even though he still can’t figure out how they manage to fly.
He often notes how many birds he saw in a day in his notepad. Given his limited ability with numbers he
can only count write down numbers from zero to nine. He also sometimes writes small notes about the birds using letters.

## Input
Your function takes a single input `birds`, which is a string that may contain both letters and digits.

## Output 
Return the sum of all digits as an integer in `birds`.

## Example

```py
assert(num_birds("3 4 FUNNY BIRD63 14 7") == 28)
```

is correct because 3 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 28
