# Getting Started: How to Solve These Problems

Before diving into the adventure, let's get familiar with how these questions work.

Each question will follow a standard format:
* A narrative regarding the question
* A **problem description**
* A description of the **inputs** and **outputs**
* Possibly some **rules or constraints**
* One or more **examples** to clarify the task


Your job is to write a function that solves the task exactly as described. You can assume that inputs will follow the rules, unless stated otherwise.


## Task

Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.


## Input

Your function takes two inputs:

* `x`: an integer
* `y`: an integer


## Output
Return the sum of `x` and `y`.


## Example

```py
assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

## Notes

* Your solution must return the output not print it.
* The example above shows how the function will be tested.
