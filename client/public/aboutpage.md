# About This Site

## Welcome

Hi! I am the creator of this site. I hope that you find the questions here useful and fun.


## Purpose

This site is meant to serve as a set of programming questions, especially focusing on elementary level questions. The only thing you need for starting is the basic Python syntax, which you can learn from [any beginner resource](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw). You do not need any knowledge of data structures and algorithms, which is required for most code-solving sites such as LeetCode.


## Getting Started

You can start solving questions immediately in any order. The questions are sorted from simple to less simple, but objectively giving questions a difficulty is notoriously difficult. You can optionally create an account to track the questions that you have solved across devices, but it will still be tracked on your browser’s local storage if you do not. Signup is entirely handled by OAuth; in general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public.


## How to Read a Question

Each question is composed of two parts. The flavour text is meant to give some fun context to the question, and for the most part it is not required to solve the question. The actual question will always be below the flavor text, which should contain all information needed to solve the question. If you are not in the mood for reading a short story, you can just jump to that part.


## Features

Unlike most sites for solving coding questions, you can view each test case for a given question. You can also check hints (if there are any) for a given question or view the solutions. You are solely responsible for how you learn from these questions.


## Suggested Learning Strategy

You are free to employ any strategy for learning from these questions. My approach would be that you are free to Google any part that you need for the solution except for the question as a whole itself. For example, if you know that you need to do x, y, z to solve a question, instead of googling the question itself, google x, y, z separately and put them together yourself.

I would also try to scribble a solution without using code (on paper or a tool like Paint) before starting a question to build a diagram on how the code should act. You can see a good example of this practice [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLlXCFG5TnA).

If you are totally stuck and cannot produce anything even after trying to come up with a solution for 30 minutes, it is fine to look at the solution. At that point, you have already spent so much time trying to come up with a solution that once you are given the solution you will probably internalize it.

Again, feel free to use any approach; this is just my approach to coding questions.
